Introduction
============

The pkgparse library parses [PKGBUILD] files. These files hold metadata and
build instructions for making ALPM packages. The format originated from the
[Archlinux] distribution. These files are simply bash scripts, with
specifically named variables. The pkgparse library extracts the values of
these variables and enables access to them.
